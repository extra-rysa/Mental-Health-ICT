		<h2>The PISAY Community</h2>
		<p>	  Congratulations! You passed the NCE! You are part of the 0.1% of the examinees who were able to reach Main Campus! 
		As you face your first quarter, it somewhat felt like 4th quarter already, with all the hectic workload and 
		requirements you need to pass, either constantly or simultaneously. You felt a sensation as though you have 
		been vomiting daily, spinning for the past week and has finally stopped, or overall having a brain surgery, 
		with your brain feeling as though a thousand needles stabbed you and punctured your scalp and skull directly 
		to your brain. My goodness, you have experienced a breakdown, a mental breakdown. You start to question everything. 
		Why am I here? Am I really part of the 0.1%? Do I deserve this? Do the people I meet hate me all the time? 
		Should I end it all? These questions spiral in your head, like a merry-go-round at Disney World. Finally, as your 
		breakdown ended, only one question left your head, How will I be saved from breaking down?</p>

		<p>		PSHS-MC, mostly its Guidance and Counselling Unit, has been constantly giving us suggestions to solve 
		these mental issues and by breaking the stigma that often goes with it. One of said solutions was 
		observing October as Mental Health Month, to celebrate, improve, influence the awareness amongst other 
		people, all the while also breaking the negativity and hateful statements about mental issues. The GCU 
		also is open all the time to help you if such breakdowns arise in school. Although we have to admit that 
		PSHS-MC is doing its best to protect mental health, it isn't doing enough.</p>

		<p>		When discussing issues of mental health to scholars, they treat it as a norm, that people constantly 
		breakdown or cry due to requirements and personal affairs, and that is a harsh truth. The fact that a 
		student is having a meltdown, because of a simple sheet of paper or computer work can't be done on time;
		being constantly joked about within the campus should not be a “norm”. It was never normal. Now is the
		time to break these "norms" and replace them with the norms we should actually see: happy people, relaxing 
		environments, and safe spaces for everyone, not just for the Iskolar ng Bayan.</p>

		<h3>Student Testimonials</h3>
		<p>Students from various batches, even campuses, volunteered to answer a quick survey - and
		here's some of their answers:</p>
		
		<h4>1) Do you think that the issue of Mental Health is relevant in Pisay? How so?</h4>
		
		<br><br>
		
		<div class="pic">
			<img src="../images/friends3.jpg" alt="PSHS Students" style="height:100%;width:100%">
		</div>
		
		<div class="even">
				<p>Yes, because it is somehow obvious that I experience psychological episodes every now and then, Pisay students 
			tend to overthink their academic performance and think that they are not good enough or they become very stressed 
			about being the best in the requirements. Even I, a freshman student can notice myself being overly-conscious about 
			my grades in requirements of a certain subject that will in turn, stress me and makes me hard to focus. It's like a 
			cycle that will really break you down if you don't change your stance.

		<div class="odd">
			<p>Coupled with the never ending requirements, struggling friendships, insecurities, group projects, and others, 
			they start to strain their mental health.
			<i> (Troy Valencia, 14 y/o, MC, 2023)</i></p>
			
			<p>The academic load and other issues with the system are among several factors that could negatively affect our 
			mental health.
			<i>(Sophia Cancio, 18 y/o, CLC, 2019)</i></p>
		</div>
		
		<br><br>
		
		<div class="even">
			<p>For me, this mental health issue is relevant in pisay because first of all- there is pressure and stress on 
			the students due to requirements or social life, which may lead to stigma. Second, this also is an aspect 
			students tend to forget because of their jam-packed schedules and deadlines. Third, mental disorders are not a 
			choice; being situational and as we know- there are students in pisay from different paths of life. 
			<i>(Anon, 14 y/o, MC, 2023)</i></p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="odd">
			<p>Yes, because (1) Mental Health can affect academic performance; (2) Pisay is partially responsible for the 
			mental illnesses the students are experiencing. (3) The school should care about its students' mental health.
			<i>(Anon, 14 y/o, CBZRC, 2023)</i></p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="even">
			<p>Considering the fact that being a Pisay scholar means being subjected to a very rigorous academic program and 
			not only that, we (or most of us) spend 5 days a week away from our parents starting from the age of 11/12/13 
			(depending on what year and month you were born), I think that mental health is very much relevant in Pisay. Not 
			only are we stressed and pressured, we are also, at the same time, dealing with homesickness (especially us weekenders 
			since we only get to go home for a few days or weeks every few months) is a lot to handle at a young age.
			<i>(Sacha Abundo, 17 y/o, BRC, 2020)</i></p>
		</div>
		
		<br><br>
		
		<div class="odd">
			<p>As regular Filipino kids that happened to be selected as the cream of the cream of the crop, most of us will most 
			probably feel a sudden change in atmosphere. Whereas before we once were considered elites now we feel as if we can't 
			even do the most basic of things. I'm not sure about others, but I know me and a friend of mine have felt that way 
			more than once. Therefore it is important for us to know our self worth in order to improve our mental health.
			<i>(Anon, 14 y/o, MC, 2023)</i></p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="even">
				<p>I believe it is relevant. As scholars we're met with many expectations from parents, friends, teachers, or ourselves. 
			For some people these expectations don't meet reality and we have to either stop caring about these expectations or 
			force ourselves to work harder. Both of these are easier said than done and altogether this can lower self esteem, 
			motivation, or simply tire out a young student. This then takes a toll on the student's mental health.
			<i>(Sidney Fernando, 15 y/o, MC, 2023)</i></p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="odd">
			<p>Yes because I believe that some students here in pshs are slowly drowning in the high expectations that was given 
			to them since day 1. They start getting stressed to the point where they can't even properly process information.

		<h4>2) Have you ever had a mental breakdown? How did you cope with it?</h4>
		
		<br><br>
		
		<div class="odd">
			<p>I never really had a mental breakdown. The closest I got to it was when I needed to get it out to a certain someone but it 
			wasn't a real breakdown as defined by the internet.
			<i>(Troy Valencia, 14 y/o, MC, 2023)</i></p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="even">
			<p>Naalala ko ung first time kong umiyak sa pisay. Di ko sure kung considered yun na mental breakdown pero kasi natabunan 
			na ako ng reqs nun, tapos nagpanic ako. Kasama ko mga kaibigan ko nun saka buhay pa ung caf. Napahagulgol na lang ako sa harap nila. I managed to cope with it 
			kasi nga kasama ko sila nun and very thankful ako na may karamay ako. I currently go to therapy every weekend. If ever nagkaroon ako ng attack, I should stop whatever I was doing and take 5-10 minutes to breathe, and focus solely 
			on my breathing hanggang maayos na paghihinga ko.

			<p>Usually, I just keep all the stress and pain to myself but there are times that it's so hard and the pain is already manifesting 
			physically that I just let it all out by crying. It may sound weird but it helps.

		<div class="even">
			<p>I’ve had an embarrassingly large number of mental breakdowns. I cried a lot, either stress ate or hardly ate, sometimes I wouldn’t 
			have the energy to shower… I also slept in class a lot. I kept trying to find reasons to keep showing up at school and doing my work, 
			too. At some point I became desensitized, I guess, and I was somehow able to still do requirements while breaking down. It’s… crazy.

		<h4>3) Do you think Pisay has done a good job in practicing activities that promote mental health?</h4>
		
		<br><br>
		
		<div class="odd">
			<p>Hindi pa actually sa aking palagay. I mean, oo, naandyan ang GCU, pero parang di ko nakikita ang epekto. Opinion ko lang 'to pero ayun.
			<i>(Jorel Naval, 14 y/o, MC, 2023)</i></p>
			
			<p>For me, not quite. I mean, Pisay is discussing these issues but in practicing activities to promote mental health is not quite sufficient.
			<i>(John Zate, 12 y/o, BRC, 2025)</i></p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="even">
			<p>Not as much tbh. In my humble opinion, kung talagang gusto nilang ma-promote mental health, I think kailangang bawasan reqs. 
			Gets ko naman na isa lang din naman ung req na binibigay kada subject, pero sabihin nating sampu ung subjects natin, edi sampu rin 
			ung projects na kailangang gawin... Isa nga lang ako sa mga taong nakakakuha ng 6hrs of sleep. Others get less or even no sleep at all.
			<i>(Anon, 15 y/o, MC, 2023)</i></p>

		<div class="odd">
			<p>Recently they’ve been doing better, I can say that, but my answer is still no. 
			I don’t see the real changes that are supposed to be done.
			<i>(Sophia Cancio, 18 y/o, CLC, 2019)</i></p>
			
			<p>Mental health is as equally important as physical health, if not more, because issues with your mental health could prevent you 
			from functioning normally in your day to day life.

			<p>From my perspective, yes. We have peer facilitators who listen to our problems. And naglagay ng stress reliever na aso yung campus namin.
			<i>(Anon, 14 y/o, CBZRC, 2023)</i></p>
			
			<p>No. Yes, they promote it but they don't really act upon it; so it's pretty bad, plus the students don't really trust the guidance unit.
			<i>(Anon, 15 y/o, MC, 2023)</i></p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="even">
			<p>I don't know about other campuses but here in BRC, I guess they did an okay job back then but stuff happened and then they took

			<i>(Sacha Abundo, 17 y/o, BRC, 2020)</i></p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="odd">
			<p>Pisay has done only mediocre on activities related to mental health in my opinion. Things like the school fair or like the home study day 
			were helpful. There weren't really that much activities adressing the problem on mental health. After PSHS got ISO Certified, Most students 
			are burdened with saturday classes and the loss of the home study days. So, for me, they didn't do a good job.

		<h4>4) Do you think Mental Health is a relevant and a topical issue for your age group? Why?</h4>
			
		<br><br>
		
		<div class="odd">
			<p>Yes since I have classmates that are having a hard time in some subjects, they seem to let go of the word 'depressed' as a way to describe 
			themselves. We really need more information about Mental Health so that we may have a proper understanding about the said topic especially 
			to not interchange words that may mean much graver things.
			<i>(Anon, 12 y/o, MC, 2025)</i></p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="even">
			<p>I don’t think our “emo phase” is just a phase. There are students out there who are actually suffering from mental illnesses. We don’t usually 
			hear them because they are afraid of speaking out. In short, I think that mental health should be addressed in a more serious light because we don’t truly 
			know what battles other people are going through lalo na dahil marami talagang factors na pumapasok dito, di lang sa school, pati na rin sa mga bahay nila.

			<p>I remember that being a graduating student wasn’t as easy as I thought it’d be… I thought I was just gonna have to do another year and I’d get out. 
			But the whole issue of college and courses… and taking care of everything you need just to graduate… it still was very taxing and I myself have 
			frequently visited the guidance office because of it.
			<i>(Sophia Cancio, 18 y/o, CLC, 2019)</i></p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="odd">
			<p>Yes, because these mental health issues are literally life threatening especially sa mga adolescents. 
			<i>(Anon, 14 y/o, CBZRC, 2023)</i></p>
			
			<p>Add to the fact that we are still growing teenagers, A lot of stress may eventually breakdown a person which may or may not eventually result in 
			depression. So, in order to help, we need to know about mental health to able to help people because some may already be depressed or have a mental illness.
			<i>(Troy Valencia, 14 y/o, MC, 2023)</i></p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="even">
			<p>As I said in the first question, we scholars are separated from out families at a young age and we are also, for the lack of a better word, 
			deprived, of a normal life. We basically turn into adults in this institution. I've been here for almost 6 years and I can tell you that it is 
			a really relevant and topical issue because the six years are very physically, emotionally, mentally, and psychologically draining. On many 
			occasions, thoughts have come across my mind, and I know for sure that I'm not the only one.

			<p>I do think it is a relevant issue, especially at a time where suicide rates are rising because of mental health issues such as depression. 
			Before, the topic was just dismissed as something that is unimportant or is just utter [redacted]. Again, many people commit suicide 
			because of depression and other similar illnesses. This should be something that is seriously talked about now.
			<i>(Neil Naorbe, 15 y/o, MC, 2023)</i></p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="odd">
			<p>Of course its a topical and relevant issue for my age group because this stage of our lives is when we encounter complex situations and obstacles, 
			a shift from child to adult, and experiencing that huge change can be overwhelming.
			<i>(Anon, 15 y/o, MC, 2023)</i></p>
			
			<p>A lot of kids my age are already beginning to show signs of depression, anxiety or pressure. The pressure and standards of society are high

		<h4>5) How can people help when they encounter problems likewise (having a mental breakdown, 
		knowing someone having a mental issue, etc.)?</h4>
			
		<br><br>
		
		<div class="odd">
			<p>Personally, when people are down or stressed, we should let them be first to be in touch with their mentality and emotions before 
			we try to cheer them up. As friends or family, or even just being a supportive classmate, batchmate, or schoolmate, we should try to 
			cheer the people around us and try to keep them from stressing out to much by helping them in what they are having a hard time with 
			as stressing too much can lead to breakdowns and depression.

			<p>It’s important to keep in mind that you’re allowed to tell someone when you don’t have the capacity to help them. One could be lending

			<p>Just talk to them. Don't give them any advice, don't give them that [redacted] about how they should cheer up because the world

			just, really, don't bring up "God's plans for *insert name here* or tell them to cheer up because that will just make them feel worse or

			<p>Respect, understanding, and lots of GENUINE love and support. Not just "kaya mo yan!" and "laban pa!". People should actually take the time

			compliments and friendly words. Our culture has a bad habit of telling people that they're gonna be okay and telling people that they're worthy 
			without actually making them feel worthy. If someone genuinely wants to help, they should put down their posters and hashtags and open their arms.

		<h3>Teacher Testimonials</h3>
		<p>We asked 2 teachers, and even got to have a recorded video interview with one, on what they
		think the situation on Mental Health here in Pisay is:</p>
		
		<div class = "questions">
			<h5>Name:</h5> <h3>Mark Lester B. Garcia</h3>
			<h5>Unit:</h5> <h3>Math Unit</h3>
			<h5>What grade level are you currently teaching?</h5> <h3>Grade 9</h3>

		</div>
		
		<br><br>
		
		<div class="questions">
			<h5>1) What is your opinion regarding mental health? What do you think constitutes as Mental Health?</h5>
			<p>Mental health is the state of one's mental, emotional, and psychological well-being. </p>
			
			<h5>2) In your opinion, what is a mental illness? What constitutes as a mental illness?</h5>
			<p>Mental illness is the lack of ability to regulate one's emotions and thoughts especially when 
			subjected to immense external or internal pressure or stress.</p>
			
			<h5>3) Do you think that PSHS-MC is doing something about mental health? Kindly expound.</h5>
			<p>The unit that is primarily concerned in dealing with the mental health of students is the Guidance 
			and Counseling Unit, and it conducts various programs and activities that spreads information on how 
			to promote mental health and wellness. Other than the GCU, the teachers and homeroom advisers have 
			their own ways and means in promoting mental health, such as checking on their students from time to 
			time, talking to them individually, and so on.</p>
			
			<h5>4) Do you think Mental Health is a relevant issue, especially to the students 
			of the Pisay community? Why?</h5>
			<p>Yes it is, as students in Pisay are pressured to do better than average since they are scholars.</p>
			
			<h5>5) What ideas can you recommend to the ManComm regarding unresolved mental issues in Pisay?</h5>
			<p>Some sensitive topics related to mental health are depression and suicide. I think this is one 
			of the things that should be discussed with students. Of course, there are many precautionary 
			measures that should be considered with this move, but I strongly propose that an expert in the 
			field of psychology must talk to students about these issues because students can sometimes feel 
			that they have no one to talk to openly about them.</p>
			
			<h5>6) As a teacher, do you encounter students having mental illnesses/breakdowns in class? 
			What do you do to help?</h5>
			<p>Yes. The important thing for me to make sure that I know the student personally, 
			I check on him/her from time to time, and assure the student that if he/she needs any help, 
			I can make myself available.</p>
			
			<h5>7) What can you say to those struggling in Pisay with a mental illness? Any advice for them?</h5>	
			<p>That you are not alone, it is okay not to be okay, and the people around you love you for 
			who you are  and are willing to help you as for as long as you reach out and seek for help.</p>
