		<h2>What is Mental Health?</h2>
		<div>
			<section class="whattext">
				<p>According to the <b>World Health Organization,</b> Mental Health is a status in which a person can adapt 
				to daily problems, work successfully and usefully, and help society. Health overall, however, does not 
				necessarily mean the absence of disease or infirmity, but rather the state of physical, mental, 
				and social well-being.</p>

			<section class="whytext">
				<p>According to <b>Mental Health America,</b>19% of adults suffer from mental illnesses, 
				so do 46% of teenagers and 13% of children. Throughout history, these kinds of illnesses 
				are somewhat brushed off,”take a walk” would be a common response. With the raging increase 
				of suicide and self-harm, it is time or rather, it has been time since we had to break the stigma.</p>
				
				<p>For us, we think that learning about Mental Health is now extremely relevant, especially since we,
				aged 14 years old, are also experiencing it. We think that if these issues aren't addressed now then maybe
				it would be too late to do so later on.</p>
