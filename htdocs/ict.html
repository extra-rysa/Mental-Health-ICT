		<h3>Solution 1:</h3>
			<br><br>
			<section class="odd">
				<h4>Apps</h4>
					<p><b>Apps that range from Eating Disorders to Schizophrenia</b> are mostly beneficial due to convenience, 
					anonymity, and a low price. The problem emerges when user-patients use these apps for stand-in to 
					actual medical treatment. Most applications lack peer-reviewed research, partly because tech companies 
					improve quicker than traditional scientific testing. Although these apps lack scientific backing, 
					another research shows an improvement, or a positive result from the user-patients.
					We also recommend visiting 
					
					<a href="https://www.psycom.net/25-best-mental-health-apps">

					to find certain apps to help you.</p>

		<br><br>
		
		<div class="piceven">
			<img src="../images/2.jpg" alt="Online Therapy" style="width:100%">
		</div>
		
		<section class="even">
			<h4>Online Videos (for Therapy)</h4>
			<p><b>Online Therapy through Video</b> seems to be a good solution for patients due to the shortage 
			of mental health professionals. One of its upsides is the fact that this is efficient for people who 
			lack the resources to have an actual appointment in-person, or are simply, quite afraid of the stigma.</p>
		</section>
		
		<br><br><br><br>
		
		<h3>Solution 3:</h3>
		
		<br><br>
		
		<section class="odd">
			<h4>Behavior Tracking Software</h4>
			<p><b>Behavior Tracker Apps</b> create digital phenotypes or detectors based on your interaction 
			(with consent and permission) through cell phones, such as not responding to texts, and analyzes it. 
			Not responding to texts of friends and family could be a sign of depression or an increase in 
			shopping spree would be an indicator of mania.</p>

		<div class="piceven">
			<img src="../images/4.png" alt="Medical Recording Software" style="width:100%">

		<section class="even">
			<h4>Medical Recording Software</h4>
			<p><b>Medical Recording Software</b> are being used by insurance companies to identify patients at 
			risk for mental illnesses. After this, they are treated through a network of mental health specialists.</p>

		<h3>Solution 5:</h3>
		
		<br><br>
		
		<section class="odd">
			<h4>VR Treatment</h4>
			<p><b>VR Treatment</b> has been used for exposure therapy to treat many who have PTSD. Exposure therapy 
			is when patients are made to relive their trauma in a safe environment. VR is also used to understand and 
			cope borderline personality disorder, wherein people have difficulty controlling their emotions.</p>

			<h4>Depression Tests</h4>
			<p><b>Depression Tests</b> have been made by Google in coordination with the National Alliance on Mental 
			Illness (NAMI) in order to determine depression. Other than that, there are also tests online such as this 
			one from 
				<a href="https://depression.org.nz/is-it-depression-anxiety/self-test/">
