			<p> It is a biological need for a every living thing to eat, as it serves fuel for our frolicking and living. Only few are aware of an ongoing epidemic that is damaging the mere fabric of one's self. These are <b>Eating Disorders</b>, disorders that not only damage the mind, but also aim to damage a person's body systems. This site will help you understand 3 different Eating Disorders: Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia Nervosa, and Binge-Eating Disorder.</p>
			</div>
			
			<br><br>
			
			<div class="eating1">
				<h3>What is Anorexia Nervosa?</h3>
					<p>People with anorexia nervosa often see themselves as overweight, even if they are dangerously underweight. People with it constantly weigh themselves and restrict themselves food.
					<p> Anorexia nervosa has the highest mortality rate of any mental disorder. Although many of them die from starvation, some of them die of suicide.
			</div>
			
			<div class="eating2">
				<h3> What is Bulimia Nervosa? </h3>
					<p> Bulimia Nervosa is an eating disorder usually characterized by periods of excessive eating, followed by some activity that compensates the previous activity. Some purge by forcing a vomit, some drink laxatives, fast, and exercise excessively.
					<p> People with bulimia fear gaining weight; but this does not necessarily mean that they are underweight. Some who have bulimia are overweight/obese who purge in order to prevent weight.
			</div>
			
			<div class="eating3">
				<h3> What is a Binge-Eating Disorder? </h3>
					<p> People with a Binge-Eating disorder have no control over their eating habits. People with BEDs don't purge after binge-eating, which is the reason why most people with BEDs are often overweight or obese.
					<p> Having Binge-eating disorder is unlike bulimia, where the food one binge-eats is followed by intense purging.
					<p>Binge-eating disorder is the most common eating disorder in the United States.

			<div class="HealthAnorex">
				<p> Anorexia poses health risks being that it is an eating disorder. The body is denied essential nutrients that it needs in order to function properly, due to anorexia nervosa's cycle of self-starvation. Thus the body is forced to slow down all process in order to preserve energy, which in turn can lead to serious medical consequences.
				
				<p class="quote"><i> "The body is generally resilient at coping with the stress of eating disordered behaviors, and laboratory tests can generally appear perfect even as someone is at high risk of death. Electrolyte imbalances can kill without warning; so can cardiac arrest. Therefore, itâ€™s incredibly important to understand the many ways that eating disorders affect the body." </i><p>

			<div class="HealthBulim">
				<p> Bulimia is treatable. Like all the eating disorders here, they can all be cured. One of the ways people get healed here is through <i> psychotherapy </i>wherein a therapist helps you manage stress and avoid the cycle of binging and purging.
				<p> Bulimia can also be treated by prescribing Antidepressants to the patients who suffer from it. Although psychiatric medications are not effective to everyone (being that everyone has different tolerances etc.), some people find relief in taking antidepressants.
				<p class= "quote"><i>If you think you may benefit from inpatient treatment for bulimia, talk to your therapist or psychiatrist to determine the best course of action. If you feel you are an immediate danger to yourself or someone else, seek help and medical treatment immediately. Call emergency services in your area or go to the emergency room of the nearest hospital. You can also do research on this site to learn about some of your treatment options.</i></p>
