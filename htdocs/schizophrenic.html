			<h2> What is Schizophrenia? </h2>
			<p>Schizophrenia is a mental disorder that affects brain function which can lead to chronic problems with broken and disordered thoughts and emotions. Schizophrenia requires longterm treatment in order for the illness to disappear.

		<div class="stats">
			<h2> Schizo-tistics </h2>
				<p> Researchers estimate that 3-7 people in 1000 have schizophrenia. It is said that schizophrenia slightly affects men more than women. Schizophrenia normally begins between ages of 15 and 25.</p>
		</div>
		
		<br><br><br><br>

		<center>
			<div class="head">
				<h2> Symptoms </h2>
					<p> The symptoms of schizophrenia can be classified as 'positive' or 'negative' symptoms. These terms don't refer to the symptoms as good or bad, but rather how they are being presented.</p>
			</div>
		</center>
		
		<br><br><br>
		
		<div class="head2">
			<h2> Positive Symptoms </h2>
				<p> Positive symptoms are constant problems that should not be present. They are called Positive vaguely since they represent an addition to a person's daily routine.

		<section class="odd">
			<h3> Hallucinations </h3>
				<p> During a <b>hallucination</b>, the person tends to see, hear, feel, or smell something that is not ther. The most often of cases being the ability to hear something that most people don't. People can experience these voices as intrusive thoughts, but they often seem to come externally. The voices that they usually hear are either threatening, comforting, or anything in between. 
		</p>
		</section>

		<section class="even">
			<h3> Delusions </h3>
				<p><b>Delusions</b> are false beliefs that are held by a person but are only known to that person only. Someone with a delusion has a fixed view of that belief and cannot be convinced otherwise. An example would be that the person believes that he is a part of a major government conspiracy.
		</section>
				
		<section class="odd">
			<h3> Disorganized Speech </h3>
				<p> It is difficult to understand a person with disorganized speech as they are frequently changing discussions that are deemed nonsensical by the listener. Externally, the sentences are all jambed up but in the speaker's mind, it is connected to their internal experience </p>
		</section>

		<div class="head2">
			<h2> Negative Symptoms </h2>
				<p> Negative symptoms are defined as characteristics that seem to be absent or lacking in someone. These negative symptoms are harder to treat than positive symptoms.

		<section class="even">
			<h3> A decrese in emotional expression </h3>
				<p> This is defined as the lack of ability for a person to say what he feels, usually, the person tends to cover it up.</p>
			<h3> Lack of initiation in goal-directed activities</h3>
				<p> This is defined as the lack of initiative or the capability to begin a goal-oriented task. Perhaps the cause is the lack off concentration posed by the other symptoms, but it is sure that the person may not be able to do these activities in a short span of time due to the lack of initiative thee person has.
				</p>
		</section>
		
		<section class="odd">
			<h3> Other symptoms</h3>
				<p> People can have additional symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, remembering, and planning. They can also pose harm in their self as they may also have poor self-care and poor interpersonal, social, and work functioning. having schizophrenia also limits the person to joining social gatherings and participate in meaningful relationships.<p>
		</section>
		
		<section class="even">
			<h2> Symptom Fluctuation and Onset </h2>
				<p> The symptoms of schizophrenia start to appear gradually between adolescence and the person's mid-30's. Some symptoms appear earlier than others. Symptoms can also have times of worsening(relapses/flares) and improvement. WIth treatment, most symptoms tend to go away (most of them positive symptoms). There can be periods (6 months or longer) wherein a person can experience no symptoms or only mild ones, called Disease Remission.</p>
		</section>

		<div class="diagnosis">
			<h2> Brain Changes and Diagnosis </h2>
				<p> The following are some brain regions thought to have disordered functioning in schizophrenia:
					<ul>
						<li> Medial temporal lobe (working memory)</li>
						<li> Superior temporal lobe (processing auditory information) </li>
						<li> Prefontal lobe (decision-making, inhibition)</li>
					</ul>
					
				It is difficult to detect schizophrenia as it shows similar symptoms to medical conditions such as dementia, brain tumor, endocrinal inflammatory conditions, a brain tumor and delirium. With diagnosis, it is important that one checks up for up until 6 months; if one or a relative has had the symptoms but for only less than a month, that is a 'brief psychotic disorder'.</p>

		<div class="risks">
			<p> One can get schizophrenia through genetics but it does not necessarily mean that having a relative with schizophrenia would immediately mean that you'd have schizophrenia too. Some of the factors of schizophrenia include: Obsteric birth complications, Early infection of the nervous system, childhood trauma, and <b>social adversity</b> such as economic downfall, lack of education, etc.
		</div>
		
		<div class="treatment">
		<h2> How do we treat schizophrenic disorders?</h2>
				<p> Ideally, schizophrenic treatment involves a combination of multidisciplinary approaches, such as psychiatric medication, psychological treatment, and social support, and many people would have to be initially hospitalized but not for a long time, only for condition stabilization.
				<p> Other forms of treatment include therapy, medication, and having support groups. Cognitive behavioral therapy can help patients learn to identify and alter their emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. Of course they could be treated, but they can't treat it without knowing it, which is why treatment begins with asking for help. <b>Don't be afraid to ask for help</b>

						<ul>

		<div class="coping">
			<h3> How do you cope with schizophrenia? </h3>
				<p> People with schizophrenia have a hard time in life compared to those without. They continue to battle themselves and their tendencies in order to thrive. Yet although this is their own fight, we can help them overcome their battles.<b> It is essential for the family and friends to be there during their fight.</b> This can lead to a much more open conversation of schizophrenia, and making known their illnesses to everyone concerned.

			<h3> Common Misconceptions about Schizophrenia </h3>
			<ol>
				<li> People with Schizophrenia have multiple personalities.</li>
				<li> Having a diagnosis is rare.</li>
				<li> Schizophrenia = Violent Behavior </li>
				<li> The disorder worsens <b> ALWAYS</b>
			</ol>
			
			<p> The truth is that each person's fight with schizophrenia is unique. Even if they have similar treatment, 
			each and everyone can have distinct experiences, degree of remission or progression, and response to different treatments.
