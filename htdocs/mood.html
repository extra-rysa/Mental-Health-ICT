			<h3> Major Depression </h3>
			<p> <b>Depression</b> is a mood disorder that is related to having a constant feeling of sadness. This is not to be confused to constant mood swings that people usually experience in a day-to-day basis.
			Many things can lead to depression, but mostly major life events, like a death of a relative. Doctors only consider grief as part of depression if they manage to persist.

				<li> a depressed mood </li>
				<li> a decrease in interest on activities one previously enjoys </li>
				<li> lack of libido </li>

				<h3> Bipolar Disorder </h3>
					<p>This disorder, also known as a <b>manic-depressive illness</b> is a brain disorder that causes odd shifts in mood, energy, activity level, and the ability to live a life. Bipolar Disorders often have moods that range from elated, and energized behavior (manic episodes) to very sad, hopeless, suicidal behavior (depressive episodes), with less severe manic episodes (hypomaniac episodes). Bipolar Disorders are sorted into 4:
						<ul>
							<li><b>Bipolar I Disorder</b>- manic episodes that last for 7 days or long enough that the person needs hospital care immediately. They also usually have depressive episodes that take up to 2 weeks.</li>
							<li><b>Bipolar II Disorder</b>- defined by depressive and hypomaniac pattern of episodes, but not the full-frontal manic episodes.</li>
							<li><b> Cyclothymic Disorder (cyclothymia)</b>- numerous periods of hypomaniac and numerous periods of depressive episodes that last for 2 years. The symptoms do not meet the standards for a hypomaniac and a depressive episode.</li>
							<li><b> Other Specified and Unspecified Bipolar and Related Disorders</b>- other disorders that do not match either one of the three categories above.</li>
						</ul><br>
					People having manic episodes may be feeling irritated, having trouble sleeping, doing high-octane things, having fast thoughts. People having depressive episodes however feel tired, eat too much or too little, forget things a lot, think of death or suicide.</p>

			<h3> Persistent Depressive Disorder </h3>
			<p> PDDs or previously known as <b>dysthymia</b> is mild chronic depression. The patient can have similar symptoms to major depression but the only difference being that PDD's symptoms are on a lesser extent to what the symptoms of major depression are. Apart from milder symptoms, PDD also means that this kind of depression lasts longer than usual. People with PDD have been depressed for as long as they can remember. Harvard lists its symptoms:
			<p>"In this disorder, the long duration is the key to the diagnosis, not the intensity of symptoms. As with major depression, mood may be either low or irritable. An individual with persistent depressive disorder may feel less pleasure and a lack of energy. He or she may feel relatively unmotivated and disengaged from life. Appetite and weight can increase or decrease. The person may sleep too much or have trouble sleeping. Indecisiveness, pessimism and poor self-image may also be present." </p>

			<h3> Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) </h3>
			<p> SAD is a form of depression that is thought to be caused by lower light levels slowing brain function, which in turn decreases serotonin and increases melatonin in the body. It is also known as <b>winter depression</b> due to its symptoms becoming highly apparent during the winter time., with symptoms that include insomnia, lethargy, weakened immune system, apathy, and social withdrawal.</p>
			<p> The true cause of SAD is truly misunderstood, but it is highly likely related to reduced exposure to sunlight. Having a lack of sunlight might stop the <i>hypothalamus</i> to work properly, which in turn can affect the:
			<ol>
				<li><b>production of melatonin</b> - melatonin is hormone that makes you sleepy and people with SAD have bodies that may produce higher than normal levels.</li>
				<li><b>production of seratonin</b>, a hormone that affects a person's appetite, mood, and sleep. People who have SAD in turncan lead to lower serotonin levels, which is linked to having depression.</li>
				<li><b>circadian rhythm</b>- The body uses sunlight to schedule your day, like waking up. Lower light levels can lead to a disruption to one's circadian rhythm and can lead to symptoms of SAD</li>
			</ol>
